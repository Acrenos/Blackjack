- Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10, and Aces can count as 1 or 11.
- Players can:
  - **Hit**: Take another card.
  - **Stand**: Keep their current hand.
  - **Double Down**: Double the bet and take one final card.
- The dealer must hit until their cards total 17 or higher.
